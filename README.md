In this repository we share examples on how to use cron-utils libraries. We tag examples according to each release, so that you can find valid examples across all cron-utils releases. You can find them at github's [releases tab](https://github.com/jmrozanec/cron-utils-examples/releases).

Feel free to collaborate, provide examples of your own and even push examples of bugs you found: when we fix it, the example remains.
